### Online Documentation

Users with questions about ScottPlot are encouraged to investigate the following sources:

* [**ScottPlot FAQ**](https://scottplot.net/faq) - Answers for frequently asked questions

* [**ScottPlot Cookbook**](https://scottplot.net/cookbook) - Demonstrates most ScottPlot features using source code

* [**ScottPlot Demo**](https://scottplot.net/demo) - Addresses advanced GUI-related concepts using minimal demos with source code

* [**Search GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/ScottPlot/ScottPlot/issues) - Thousands of questions have been asked and you may benefit from the discussions

* [**Ask AI a Question**](/ai) - We have a special AI trained on ScottPlot's documentation, but many public LLMs are aware of ScottPlot and can provide helpful information.

### Ask a Question

* [**Creating a new GitHub Issue**](https://github.com/ScottPlot/ScottPlot/issues) is the recommended way to ask questions about ScottPlot.

* [**Join the ScottPlot Discord**](https://scottplot.net/discord/) to engage in conversation related to ScottPlot, and questions are welcome!

* [**Users may contact Scott directly**](https://swharden.com/about/#contact) but this form of communication is typically discouraged for general questions because sharing your question publicly allows other members of the open-source community to answer faster than I may be able to, and the public discussion may benefit others in the future who have a similar question.
