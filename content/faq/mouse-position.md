# Determining the Mouse Position

See the various mouse tracking and other interactive examples on the [**ScottPlot Demo**](/demo/5.0/#custom-context-menu) page.

**WPF users** should note that mouse position must be multiplied by a scale factor if the system's DPI scaling is enabled. See the [DPI Scaling FAQ Page](/faq/dpi-scaling) for more information.
